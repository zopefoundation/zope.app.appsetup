  zope.site.

3.10.0 (2009-03-19)
-------------------

- Finally deprecate the "asObject" argument of helper functions in the
  ``zope.app.appsetup.bootstrap`` module. If your code uses any of these
  functions, please remove the "asObject=True" argument passing anywhere,
  because the support for that argument will be dropped soon.

- Move session utility bootstrapping logic from ``zope.session`` into this
  package. This removes a dependency from zope.session to this package.

- Remove one more deprecated function.


3.9.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

  ``zope.app.component``.

- Move error log bootstrapping logic from ``zope.error`` into this
  package.  This removes a dependency from zope.error to this
  package. Also added a test for bootstrapping the error log here,
  which was missing in ``zope.error``.


3.8.0 (2008-08-25)
------------------

- Feature: Developed an entry point that allows you to quickly bring up an
  application instance for debugging purposes. (Implemented by Marius Gedminas

  startup.


3.6.0 (2008-07-23)
------------------

- Added additional test support functions to set the configuration for a
